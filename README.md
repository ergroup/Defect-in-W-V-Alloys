# Defects in W-V (Tungsten-Vanadium) Alloys

This Python code is designed to model and analyze tungsten–vanadium (W–V) alloys. The main goals are to:

- Introduce vanadium (V) atoms into a tungsten (W) lattice to form W–V alloys.
- Introduce vacancies (missing atoms) into these alloy structures.
- Use a brute-force search to find the optimal positions for the vacancies.

During this process:

- The positions of the V atoms remain fixed.
- Different configurations are tested by replacing W atoms with vacancies.
- The best configurations are chosen based on two criteria:
-- The average distance between the vacancies.
-- The average distance between each V atom and the surrounding vacancies.

This approach helps understand how atomic structure and vacancy placement affect the properties of W–V alloys.
